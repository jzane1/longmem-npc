# longmem-npc — Status

**Last updated:** 2026-07-13
**Phase:** second build target landed — **write path v1 is built and floor-verified** (ingest
service + thin FastAPI route + real/fake providers + NLP pass, per `write-path.md`), on top of the
floor-verified migration-01 schema. All build-time `[SETTLE-AT-BUILD]` forks are ruled (dated
entries in `decisions.md`). **One open decision owed before the demo ships:** the escalation
hard-stop failure path is a build-phase stance and must be re-ruled for production (see the
2026-07-13 write-path build entry in `decisions.md`). Next: the read path.

This is the *living* file — update it at the end of every working session. `architecture.md` changes
only when design changes; `decisions.md` is append-only.

## Deadline & framing

Single-call demo video: **mid-to-late August 2026**. Do **not** sacrifice vital features or quality
for the deadline — flag deadline pressure when relevant, but never let it drive a decision without
Jack's explicit confirmation. Portfolio target: tier-1 embodied-agent / game-AI employers. Artifact
roles are distinct: the demo video gets the introduction; the instrumentation table, the test suite,
and the structured behavior output survive the interview. Research publication comes after the demo.

## Build discipline

- **Vertical slice before depth; CLI before Unity.** First end-to-end path — event in → memory
  stored → dialogue out — is a console harness: no gate, no caching, no reflection. The CLI is the
  product surface (main file readable as documentation; debug mode exposes retrieved memory IDs,
  scores, parsed structured output, token counts). Unity is the demo; the gray-box scene recorded is
  the fallback video.
- **Staged verification:** each layer verifies against a known-good layer beneath it, so failures
  have a single cause. Anything renamed or ported is re-verified before it counts as a floor.
- **Storage before cognition. Instrument at the seam.** Framework choices must survive the
  interview; ceremony scores below absence.

## Verified floors

| Layer | Verified against | Date |
|---|---|---|
| Postgres 16 + pgvector 0.8.5 container (`longmem-pg`) + read-only Postgres MCP | live: `docker` health `healthy`, `pg_available_extensions` → `vector 0.8.5`, `claude mcp list` → `postgres ✓ Connected` | 2026-07-13 |
| Migration 01 foundational schema — 9 tables, 7 CHECKs, HNSW cosine + GIN + one-live-head + FK indexes (`db\migrations\001_foundation.sql`, applied by `db\migrate.py`) | floor-verifier **pass** on live `longmem`: every done-when re-run (idempotent second run, CHECK rejection, server UUID defaults, smoke fixture) + `vector 0.8.5` enabled; DB left pristine (only `schema_migrations`) | 2026-07-13 |
| Write path v1 — ingest service seam (`app\ingest.py`) + thin FastAPI route (`app\api.py`, served via `python -m app.serve`) + real/deterministic-fake providers (`app\providers.py`) + NLP pass (`app\nlp.py`: spaCy lg + fastcoref + VADER + Warriner VAD) + atomic insert (`app\db.py`) | floor-verifier **pass** against the migration-01 floor: structural walker `tests\verify_write_path.py` re-run independently (35 assertions covering all 14 done-when criteria) on scratch `longmem_test`; `db\migrate.py` no-arg still a clean no-op on `longmem`; product `longmem` confirmed pristine via postgres MCP; independent spot-check of live head, span offsets, and degradation rows | 2026-07-13 |

## Open questions needing Jack's ruling

- **Escalation failure path for production (owed before the demo publishes).** The v1 write path
  hard-stops a write when the gist-escalation call fails twice (fail-loud, build-phase tuning
  stance, ruled 2026-07-13). The production/demo behavior — hard-stop vs. some soft degradation —
  must be re-ruled before the demo ships. Not blocking current work.

## Session log

- **2026-07-12** — Docs established as the in-repo source of truth. Authorial seam surfaced, ruled
  (replace model), and propagated into `decisions.md`, `test-suite.md`, `migration-01.md`.
- **2026-07-12** — Claude Code workflow stack completed: CLAUDE.md files, slash commands
  (/build-task, /log-decision, /wrap-up), plan-mode default, floor-verifier and doc-auditor
  subagents, format + suite-gate hooks, .env read-deny, and MCP go-live runbooks (`mcp-setup.md`).
  This repo is now self-sufficient; the Claude Chat Project is no longer load-bearing.
- **2026-07-12** — Full-tree doc-auditor sweep. Three schema-now gaps surfaced and ruled by Jack,
  then propagated into `migration-01.md`: `scoring_failed` column on `memories`, a schema-only
  `corrections` table (diegetic correction record; mechanism deferred), and removal of the stale
  `identity_components` pruning `[SETTLE-AT-BUILD]` tag. Dated ruling appended to `decisions.md`
  (also fixes the drift-anchor wording to "the corrected head"). Re-audit clean — migration 01 is
  unblocked with no known schema omissions.
- **2026-07-13** — DB + MCP floor stood up ahead of migration 01. Committed `docker-compose.yml`
  runs `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` as `longmem-pg` (secrets interpolated from the new gitignored
  `.env`, the connection-string source); pgvector 0.8.5 confirmed available (extension enable
  deferred to migration 01). Postgres MCP registered local-scope in restricted (read-only) mode and
  verified `✓ Connected`; floor-verifier given its `mcpServers: postgres` line + MCP-preference
  directive. **Runbook deviation:** `postgres-mcp`'s `pglast` dep has no Python 3.14 wheel and won't
  build on Windows, so the MCP runs in an isolated uv-managed Python 3.13 venv (project stays on
  3.14; recorded in `decisions.md`, and `mcp-setup.md` §1 wants a matching one-line note). Live
  in-session `/mcp` tool check still pending a Claude Code restart.
- **2026-07-13** — **Migration 01 built, verified, and committed.** Seven `[SETTLE-AT-BUILD]` forks
  ruled by Jack (see the dated `decisions.md` entry): `diagnosticity_goal` text; `decay_class`
  free-text + config map with a new `decay_class_unknown` degradation flag; `affect` as three columns
  (valence/arousal/jsonb); gist child table; `identity_relevant` boolean; HNSW cosine; Python runner
  with an atomic apply-and-record `schema_migrations` ledger. `db\migrations\001_foundation.sql` +
  `db\migrate.py` + `db\smoke_test.py` written; `requirements.txt` pins `psycopg[binary]==3.3.4`
  (global 3.14). floor-verifier returned **pass** on the live DB. **Flag:** floor-verifier couldn't
  call the postgres MCP tools (fell back to `psql`); its `mcpServers` directive isn't yet effective —
  revisit before the write path. **(Resolved 2026-07-13 — see the next entry.)**
- **2026-07-13** — **Floor-verifier MCP access fixed and verified.** Root cause was the verifier's
  explicit `tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash` allowlist, which filters out every `mcp__postgres__*` tool
  (the `mcpServers: postgres` line authorizes the server connection but does not override the
  allowlist — the sub-agents docs use that exact `tools` line as their canonical "can't use any MCP
  tools" example). Added the `mcp__postgres` pattern to the allowlist in
  `.claude\agents\floor-verifier.md`. Agent definitions load at Claude Code startup, so the fix took
  effect only after a restart; a read-only probe then confirmed the floor-verifier can call
  `mcp__postgres__execute_sql` (`SELECT 1` → ok). Verification is now MCP-driven as intended.
- **2026-07-13** — **Write-path v1 build target specced** (`write-path.md`). Consolidates
  architecture §4–§5 into a build spec over the frozen migration-01 schema (no new migration). Jack
  ruled three scope forks (dated entry in `decisions.md`): surface = one ingest service (the sole
  instrumentation seam) with a thin FastAPI route and a structured `IngestResult` (IDs + scores);
  v1 events = observe + scene-boundary (accept+instrument only) + pin/unpin, with correction/purge
  deferred; models = per-role provider interfaces with a real impl + a deterministic fake. doc-auditor
  run clean after fixing one unsatisfiable done-when (byte-identical two-caller payload →
  route-is-pass-through) and three schema-alignment nits. Remaining physical shapes tagged
  `[SETTLE-AT-BUILD]` for the build.
- **2026-07-13** — **Write path v1 built, verified, and committed.** Jack ruled the four major
  build forks up front (render seam confirmed; embedding failure → NULL embedding; NLP stack =
  spaCy lg + fastcoref + VADER + **Warriner VAD** — NRC-VAD failed the Apache-2.0 license gate;
  full five-trigger escalation with fail-loud hard-stop as a **build-phase stance to re-rule
  before the demo**); minor shapes approved with the plan (dated `decisions.md` entry has all of
  it). New: `app\` (config, schemas, providers, nlp, db, ingest, api, serve),
  `data\lexicons\warriner_2013_vad.csv` (CC-BY 4.0, attributed), `tests\verify_write_path.py`
  (35-assertion structural walker), `db\migrate.py --database-uri` flag (floor re-verified).
  Environment learnings recorded in `decisions.md`: `transformers<5` pin for fastcoref;
  `en_core_web_sm` needed by fastcoref internally; spaCy model installs must use pip wheel URLs
  (spaCy's downloader hits uv and dies outside a venv); psycopg async needs a SelectorEventLoop on
  Windows → serve via `python -m app.serve`. Verification ran on scratch DB `longmem_test`
  (created/migrated/dropped around the walker); floor-verifier **pass** — walker re-run
  independently, `longmem` confirmed pristine via the postgres MCP, plus an independent
  spot-check. Route pass-through proven twice: ASGITransport JSON-equality in the walker and a
  live `python -m app.serve` HTTP session (observe + pin + scene-boundary).
- **2026-07-13** — **Full-project audit (build paused at Jack's request) + remediation.** Three
  lanes: a doc-auditor full-tree sweep, a code-vs-decisions review of the write path, and
  operational/toolchain checks. **Code verdict: clean** — the implementation matches every dated
  ruling; installed deps match the `requirements.txt` pins; live `longmem` re-confirmed pristine
  (9 tables + ledger, pgvector 0.8.5, product tables empty; the container had been down only
  because Docker Desktop wasn't started). **Fixed:** (1) the ruff format hook had been silently
  dormant since it was written — ruff is module-installed, not on PATH — `format-on-edit.ps1` now
  falls back to `python -m ruff`; proven live, and the accumulated drift was normalized
  (`python -m ruff format .`, 7 files, formatting only, imports re-verified). (2) Eleven doc
  findings (4 contradictions, 7 unpropagated rulings) + 2 re-audit residuals propagated:
  `write-path.md` (BUILT banner, settle-tag/flag ruling annotations, five triggers, hard-stop
  ladder row + principles exception, IngestResult `embedding_failed`/escalation fields, the four
  build-ruled done-when bullets), `architecture.md` (five triggers, hard-stop exception in §2,
  ruled NLP stack, escalation model role), `CLAUDE.md` (escalation in the role list),
  `mcp-setup.md` (uv `--python 3.13` pglast note — closes the flagged follow-up; floor-verifier
  runbook now prescribes the `tools: mcp__postgres` allowlist, the proven fix), `test-suite.md`
  (unknown-decay-class, embedding-failure, and hard-stop degradation cases), and a
  superseded-in-part note on the 2026-07-12 decay/gist entry in `decisions.md` (the register
  header's own convention). (3) `app\config.py`'s unused `nlp_confidence_threshold` comment now
  reads RESERVED (not consulted in v1 — no confidence source exists). **No floor changed; no new
  decisions ruled** — the escalation failure-path re-rule remains the open question. Doc-auditor
  re-audit clean apart from the two residuals, which were fixed and grep-verified.

## Immediate queue

1. Read path: dialogue-init top-k with IDs + scores.
2. CLI harness (vertical slice complete) + synthetic load driver alongside.
3. Unity project + reference scene — connect MCP for Unity first (`mcp-setup.md`).
4. Before the demo ships: re-rule the escalation failure path (see open questions) and pick a
   real-provider smoke moment (one live observe with keys) ahead of demo choreography.

*(Done 2026-07-13: **Write path v1** — see the verified-floors table and session log. Earlier same
day: **Migration 01 foundational schema**; connect the Postgres MCP + floor-verifier MCP access.)*

## Open artifact queue (writing tasks against settled decisions — not decisions)

- Event-ingestion API contract — **v1 subset specced in `write-path.md` and now BUILT** (observe +
  scene-boundary + pin/unpin; phase tag and event_id accepted without a schema home; idempotency
  accepted-not-enforced). Still to spec/build: the diegetic-correction event (references a target
  memory_id) and purge, plus scene-boundary's deferred consumers.
- Retrieval scoring function: relevance × recency(decay class) × importance_norm; pin exemption;
  normalization; slots for the future context term and per-call split-brain overrides.
- Reconstruction call spec: operator-structured prompt with gist as fixed constraint; determinism;
  batching shape.
- Reflection spec end-to-end.
- Gate threshold values + efficacy definitions wired to instrumentation.
- Unity client C# API surface: send event, open dialogue, directive callback, reputation read,
  reconstructing-signal hook, scene-boundary emission.
- Demo choreography: injected-timestamp time travel; decay + correction-override + gate-recollect
  beats now; the 60-day drift plot when reconstruction ships.
- README destructive-compression counter-example pick.

## Post-August ledger

Reflection pipeline mechanism (if not landed in August); reconstruction mechanism + drift budget +
remaining identity-conditioned-reconstruction suite scenarios; dissonance path + the diegetic suite
pair; encoding-context read term + habituation; split-brain topology with per-call weights and
re-run cost/latency instrumentation; reflection → parameter compiler; Unity Package Manager
packaging; docs final + public flip (Apache-2.0).

**Research track:** asymmetry ablation (on/off, judge-measured explanation-cause divergence); judged
drift / Bartlett-style evals; unified-thesis write-up (identity-conditioned reconstructive memory +
information-asymmetric cognition).

**Later / optional:** disclosure gate; full modulator suite for the parameter compiler;
faithful-vs-reconstructive dual read modes; the dormant-agent memory-injection overseer (next
project; wake trigger = context match); local-model packaging (note: a second embedding model
collides with the locked 1536 dimension).

## Repo conventions

Private GitHub; commit at least weekly; public flip is an end-of-project sprint. Secrets in `.env`
only. Always PowerShell, backslash paths.
