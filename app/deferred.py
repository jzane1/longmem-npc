"""deferred.py — the deferred-write enrichment worker (Phase C1;
deferred-writes.md, ruled 2026-08-12).

An in-process asyncio task owned by whoever built the services (the FastAPI
lifespan AND the REPL/load-driver SessionRunner — both construction sites
start one, so a REPL observe enriches too). Each pass drains the pending
queue: rows inserted by deferred-mode observes (`enrichment_pending`,
migration 006) get the two LLM calls the sync path would have run — the
single write call (render + importance + typology-when-undeclared) and the
escalation gist call — through the SAME module-level stage functions the
sync branch uses (app\\ingest.py), then one completion transaction
(db.apply_enrichment): the one-shot scalar fill, the 'enrichment' prose
supersede of the raw head, add-only span appends, escalation-novel
components, an opportunistic embedding repair for NULL-embedding heads, and
the cache eviction the chain-writer invariant demands.

Failure policy (deliberately different from the sync path's degrade-now,
per the C1 rulings): a failed write call records a `failed` run row and
leaves the row pending for a later drain; the attempt that spends the
budget (`deferred_max_attempts`) terminal-fills the row byte-equivalent to
the sync scoring-failed end-state. A double-failed escalation stays SOFT
(the 2026-07-22 stance): completion proceeds on the base gist with
`escalation_failed` set. A failed embedding repair stays NULL — today's
end-state.

Timing (`deferred_poll_seconds`, `deferred_batch_size`,
`deferred_max_attempts`) is process-level and reads the service defaults —
the worker has no agent context; the kill-switch (`deferred_writes_enabled`)
gates DEFERRAL at observe time only, never the drain, so flipping it off
never strands a pending row. `drain()` is the deterministic entry for tests
and walkers: no timers involved.

Instrumentation: a background worker has no response payload to ride, so
per-attempt timing and token accounting persist in memory_enrichment_runs
(written inside the completion transaction; surfaced on the unscored /chain
read). No SQL lives here — every statement is app\\db.py's (repo hygiene).

Concurrency: claims take skip-locked row locks (db.claim_enrichment_batch);
a claimed row stays pending while worked, so a second process can re-claim
it mid-flight — the completion guard makes the loser a rolled-back no-op.
Worst case is duplicate model spend, never duplicate rows. The worker holds
a pool connection only inside db calls, never across a model call.
